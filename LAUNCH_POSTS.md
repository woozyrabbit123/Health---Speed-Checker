## X/TWITTER POST (Thread Format)

**Post 1 (Hook):**
```
I got tired of PC cleaners like CCleaner that spy on you and use scare tactics.

So I built an honest alternative that tells the truth about your PC.

It's free, open source, and 100% local (no cloud, no telemetry).

Here's how it's different =G
```

**Post 2 (The Problem):**
```
Other PC cleaners:
L "1,500 errors found! Buy Pro for $29.99!"
L Sell your data to advertisers
L Install toolbars and bloatware
L CCleaner literally got caught spying

This is BS. PCs deserve better.
```

**Post 3 (Your Solution):**
```
Health & Speed Checker tells you the HONEST truth:

"Your mechanical HDD is the bottleneck. Upgrading to an SSD ($50-150) will make your PC 10x faster. Software tweaks will only help 5-10%."

No lies. No scare tactics. Just real advice.
```

**Post 4 (Features):**
```
What you get (100% FREE):
 10 system health checkers
 Security scan (firewall, ports, updates)
 Performance analysis (bloatware, RAM, CPU)
 Honest hardware bottleneck advice
 One-click fixes with changelog
 No telemetry. No tracking. Ever.
```

**Post 5 (Call to Action):**
```
It's open source (Rust + Tauri) and works on Windows/Mac/Linux.

If you're tired of sketchy PC cleaners, try the honest alternative.

## REDDIT POST (r/software)

**Title:** I built a PC health checker that tells the truth (and doesn't spy on you)

**Body:**

I was tired of PC cleaners like CCleaner and IObit that use scare tactics, spy on users, and install bloatware.

So I built an alternative that is privacy-first, honest, and free forever.

**Example of the difference:**

- **CCleaner**: "Fix 1,500 registry errors for $29.99!"
- **Health & Speed Checker**: "Your mechanical HDD is the bottleneck. SSD upgrade = 10x faster for $50-150. Software tweaks will only improve speed by 5-10%."

**What it does:**

Security Checks (5 checkers):
- Firewall status
- OS updates
- Open ports
- Bloatware detection
- Suspicious processes

Performance Analysis (5 checkers):
- Startup program bloat
- CPU/memory hogs
- Disk health (SMART)
- Network speed tests
- Hardware bottleneck analysis (the honest part)

**Why I built the "Honest Bottleneck Analyzer":**

Instead of lying with "1,500 errors!", it analyzes your actual hardware:

- HDD detected? Suggest SSD upgrade for $50-150
- Low RAM? Explain when to upgrade vs. close apps
- Good hardware? Tell you software optimization WILL help

No BS. Just truth.

**Tech Stack:**
- Rust backend (performance + safety)
- Tauri desktop app (native + small bundle)
- Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Open source (audit the code yourself)

**Download:**
- GitHub: [YOUR GITHUB LINK]
- Direct download: [YOUR WEBSITE]

It's free forever. I'm not holding features hostage.

Feedback welcome!

## HACKER NEWS (Show HN)

**Title:** Show HN: Privacy-first PC health checker that gives honest hardware advice

**URL:** https://github.com/[your-username]/health-speed-checker

**Text:**

I built a PC health/speed checker that's different from CCleaner/IObit in three ways:

1. Privacy-first (100% local, no telemetry)
2. Honest (tells you when hardware upgrade beats software tweaks)
3. Free (no feature-gating)

Example: Instead of "1,500 errors found!", it says "Your HDD is the bottleneck. SSD upgrade = 10x faster for $50-150. Software tweaks = 5-10%."

Built with Rust + Tauri. Cross-platform. Open source.

The "honest bottleneck analyzer" is the killer feature - it tells users the truth about hardware limitations instead of false promises.

## HOW TO RESPOND TO FEEDBACK

**"Is this safe? How do I know it's not malware?"**

> "Great question! Three things: 1) It's open source - audit the code yourself on GitHub, 2) It's 100% local - no network calls, no telemetry, 3) All file operations are logged in a 'changelog' you can review. Unlike CCleaner (caught spying), we have nothing to hide."

**"Why not just use Windows Defender/built-in tools?"**

> "Windows tools are good! We're showing you ALL the info in one place, giving honest advice about hardware bottlenecks, and providing one-click fixes. Think of us as a 'second opinion' that tells you the truth."

**"How do you make money if it's free?"**

> "All core features are free forever. If you want automation (scheduled scans, auto-fix), there's an optional $2.99/month Pro tier. But I'm not holding fixes hostage - that's the CCleaner model I hate."
