# 🚀 START HERE - LAUNCH IN 3 STEPS

## ✅ WHAT I JUST BUILT FOR YOU

### 1. The Killer Feature: Honest Bottleneck Analyzer
**File**: agent/src/checkers/bottleneck.rs (14KB, 288 lines)

This is your competitive moat. It tells users:
- "Your HDD is slow. SSD = 10x faster for $50-150"
- "Your RAM is low. Upgrade for $30-80 or close these apps"
- "Your hardware is good - software optimization WILL help!"

**No competitor can copy this** without admitting their product is snake oil.

### 2. Database with Forensic Changelog
**File**: agent/db/schema.sql (49 lines)

Tables created:
- `scans` - Historical tracking
- `changelog` - Every file operation logged (transparency!)
- `settings` - Automation config (for Pro tier later)

### 3. All 10 Checkers Registered
Verified in both:
- ✅ agent/src/main.rs (CLI)
- ✅ ui/src-tauri/src/main.rs (Tauri app)

Running checkers:
1. FirewallChecker
2. StartupAnalyzer
3. ProcessMonitor
4. OsUpdateChecker
5. PortScanner
6. BloatwareDetector
7. NetworkChecker
8. SmartDiskChecker
9. StorageChecker
10. **BottleneckAnalyzer** ⭐ NEW!

### 4. Launch Materials Ready
Created for you:
- ✅ **QUICK_TEST.bat** - One-click test script
- ✅ **LAUNCH_POSTS.md** - Copy-paste posts for X/Reddit/HN
- ✅ **LAUNCH_READY.md** - Full production checklist
- ✅ **TEST_AND_LAUNCH.ps1** - Detailed PowerShell test

## 🛡️ HOW TO RESPOND TO COMMENTS

### "Is this safe?"
> "It's open source - audit the code on GitHub. 100% local, no telemetry, no network calls. Unlike CCleaner (caught spying), we have nothing to hide."

### "Why not use Windows Defender?"
> "Windows tools are great! We're showing ALL the info in one place + giving honest advice about hardware bottlenecks. Think of us as a second opinion that tells you the truth."

### "How do you make money?"
> "All core features are free forever. Optional $2.99/month Pro tier for automation (scheduled scans, auto-fix). But I'm not holding fixes hostage - that's the CCleaner model I hate."

### "This saved me from buying CCleaner Pro!"
> "Exactly why I built this! Please share with friends if it helped you."
